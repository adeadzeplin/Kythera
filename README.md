This is a Beta Version of the Antikythera Model. All designs within are not final.

This program simulates the orbits of the planets in the solar system. It was designed in 3D, and as such the orbits are realistically 
modelled, happening at different angles

Upon starting up the program, the display will automatically start up. 
The pause button will hold the system in place, while the speed slider can be used to adjust how fast time passes in the simulation.
By clicking and dragging the screen the view can also be changed, rotated and zoomed
Various other features are included as well to allow further interaction with the system.
